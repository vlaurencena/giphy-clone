# Hi!

I'm kinda a clone of Giphy. 

I was built using React and [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide).

The API has some limitations, so I couldn't reproduce some sections and functionalities of the original site, and others needed some hardcoding. Buuu!

To see my live version on Heroku follow [this link](https://giphy-clone-react.herokuapp.com/) 

To run me locally, you'll need an API key. I used a .env file and a variable called REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY.
